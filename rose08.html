    <TD colspan="2"><P><STRONG>Lecture Abstract</STRONG></P>
        <P> On December 8, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower addressed the United Nations and proposed a plan for the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy -- to find &ldquo;the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.&rdquo; A robust beginning for nuclear power in the fifties and sixties was met, some decades later, by skepticism, concern and indifference.</P>
      <P> Today, fifty-five years later, the world is re-thinking the importance of nuclear energy in the context of rising global electrical demand and climate change concerns. What needs to be done to make nuclear power an efficient, reliable and safe alternative to fossil fuels? Does American have the political will for a nuclear renaissance in this country and the desire to see it happen overseas?</P>
      <P><STRONG>Biography   of Susan Eisenhower</STRONG></P>
      <P>Susan Eisenhower is President of the Eisenhower Group,   Inc, which provides strategic counsel on political, business and public   affairs projects. Ms. Eisenhower has consulted for major companies doing   business overseas such as IBM, American Express, Diebold Corporation and   Loral Space Systems and she is a Senior Director of Stonebridge   International, a Washington-based international consulting firm chaired by   former National Security Advisor, Samuel &quot;Sandy&quot;<BR />
        Berger. </P>
      <P> At the same time, she is a Distinguished Fellow of the   Eisenhower Institute, where she served as both president and chairman. After   more than twenty years in the foreign affairs field she is best known for her   work in Russia and the former Soviet Union. During that time, Ms. Eisenhower   has testified before the Senate Armed Services and Senate Budget Committees   on policy toward that region. She has also been appointed to the National   Academy of Sciences' standing Committee on International Security and Arms   Control (CISAC) where she is now serving a fourth term. In 2000, a year   before September 11, she co-edited a book, Islam and Central Asia, which   carried the prescient subtitle, An Enduring Legacy or an Evolving Threat?</P>
      <P> Ms. Eisenhower has served on many government task forces.   In the spring of 2000, the Secretary of Energy appointed Ms. Eisenhower to a   blue ribbon task force, the Baker-Cutler Commission, to evaluate U.S. funded   nuclear non-proliferation programs in Russia, and since that time she has   served as an advisor on another DOE study. In the fall of 2001, after serving   two terms on the NASA Advisory Council she was appointed to serve on the   International Space Station Management and Cost Evaluation Task Force, which   analyzed ISS management and cost overruns. She is currently a member of the   Secretary of Energy's Task Force on Nuclear Energy. She has also served as an   Academic Fellow of the International Peace and Security program of Carnegie   Corporation of New York, and is a director of the Carnegie Endowment for   International Peace and the Nuclear Threat Initiative, co-chaired by Senator   Sam Nunn and Ted Turner.</P>
      <P> Susan Eisenhower, the granddaughter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, has spoken at many diverse types of   gatherings: from Harvard and UCLA; World Affairs Councils; and corporate   gatherings; to specialist audiences, such as the one assembled at the Army   War College, where she gave the 1998 Commandant's Lecture. She has also given   full speeches, by invitation, at other prominent places, such as: the   National Press Club, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Archives, the Hollywood   Bowl, The French National Assembly, and the White House.</P>
      <P> Ms. Eisenhower's first professional experience was as a   writer. In the 1970s Ms. Eisenhower lived overseas for six years, first while   a student at the American University in Paris and then as a London resident   and stringer for The Saturday Evening Post. Later she wrote a column for   Wolfe Newspapers and went on to write for business. Within the last ten   years, Ms. Eisenhower has authored three books: two of which, Breaking Free   and Mrs. Ike, have appeared on regional best seller lists. She has also   edited four collected volumes on regional security issues &ndash; the most recent,   Partners in Space (2004) &ndash; and penned hundreds of op-eds and articles on   foreign policy for publications such as The Washington Post, The Los Angeles   Times, USA Today, the Naval Institute's Proceedings, The London Spectator,   and Gannett Newspapers. She has provided analysis for CNN International,   MSNBC, Nightline, World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, This Week with David   Brinkley, CBS Sunday Morning, Good Morning America, The News Hour with Jim   Lehrer, Fox News and Hardball, as well NPR and other nation-wide television   and radio programs.</P></TD>
