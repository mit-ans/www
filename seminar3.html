<h3><a name="gostjeva"></a>E. Gostjeva 
<p>Elena V. Gostjeva is a Research Scientist in the 
Department of Biological Engineering, MIT and also at the Institute of 
Biotechnology, Kiev, Ukraine. She graduated from Vavilov's Institute of General 
Genetics (Moskow, USSR) in 1986 and joined the "Genetic Risk Assessment" group, 
Radiobiological Expedition in Chernobyl' (Ukraine) of the USSR Academy of 
Sciences. Dr. Gostjeva studied the consequences of radiation exposure on human 
health in contaminated areas of the Ukraine and accepted the offer to become 
head of the "Genetic Risk Assessment" group at Kiev Polytechnical Institute in 
1995. She originally developed her quantitative image cytometry methods to 
detect chromosomal aberrations induced by long-term low dose radiation in 
plants, animals and humans. These methods were later applied at MIT for the 
analysis of origin of chromosomal instability in human colon adenocarcinomas and 
finding that the stem cells of organogenesis and carcinogenesis have a peculiar 
mode of DNA replication when divide symmetrically and aymmetrically. <br><br>Together with Prof. William 
Thilly, whom she met in Stockholm, 1996 working for Swedish Radiation Protection 
Instutute and married in 1997 and moved to USA, she has developed a "juvenile 
stem cell mutator" hypothesis regarding the timing and cellular location of 
tumor initiation mutations. She is organizing collaborations to develop novel 
cancer treatments aimed at eradication of cancer stem cells that curiously 
resistant to radiotherapy. The latter is a present collaboration with Prof. 
Jackie Yanch, Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT.</p><br><br><a href="seminar.html#F09" >Back to Seminar List</a>

<h3><a name="lochbaum"></a>D. Lochbaum 
<p>David Lochbaum is one of the nation's top independent 
experts on nuclear power. At UCS, he monitors safety issues at the nation's 
nuclear power plants, raises concerns with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
and responds to breaking events, such as current concerns over aging power 
plants and plant fire safety. </p>
<p>Lochbaum is a nuclear engineer by training and worked in 
nuclear power plants for 17 years. In 1992, he and a colleague identified a 
safety problem in a plant where they were working, but were ignored when they 
raised the issue with the plant manager, the utility, and the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. They decided to go to Congress, and the problem was eventually 
corrected at the original plant and at plants across the country. Concerned 
about nuclear safety and frustrated with the NRC's complacency, Lochbaum joined 
UCS in 1996. </p>
<p>He has written numerous reports, including The Good, the 
Bad, and the Ugly: A Report on Safety in America's Nuclear Power Industry, Three 
Mile Island's Puzzling Legacy, and the book Nuclear Waste Disposal Crisis. He is
